# TwitchBot
A Bot that can be used in live streams on Twitch. This bot is written in Python. The main file for this bot is Bot.py. Name of channel should be added in the channel.txt file. run.py provides easy GUI interface to the user to add custom commands to the SQLite Database.

I would like to thank my streamer friends to use my bot in their stream. 

If you wold like to use this Bot, you need to install Python 3 at https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/. Then clone/download the files in a directory/folder. Add name of channel in channel.txt file. Add custom commands in run.py. Then run Bot.py file.
